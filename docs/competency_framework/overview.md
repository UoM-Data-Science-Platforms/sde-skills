# Competency Framework Overview

The SDE Skills Competency Framework is designed to map the skills and knowledge needed by Research Technical Professionals (RTPs) working with Secure Data Environments. The framework aligns with established industry models such as the [Five Safes](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/secure-lab/what-is-the-five-safes-framework/) and [Standard Architecture for Trusted Research Environments (SATRE)](https://satre-specification.readthedocs.io/) specifications, while maintaining its unique focus on the technical skills required in secure research environments.

## Framework Structure

The framework is organised as a 3-level hierarchy:

1. **Domains** - Top-level categorization of competencies
2. **Subdomains** - Mid-level grouping of related skills
3. **Items** - Specific competencies with defined skill levels

For each competency item, we define three levels of proficiency:
- **Entry-level** - Basic understanding and application
- **Mid-level** - Independent application and implementation
- **Senior-level** - Strategic oversight and leadership

## Competency Domains

Our competency framework is organised around six core domains that align with both the Five Safes model and SATRE specification:

1. **Safe Technology & Engineering** - Technical implementation of secure systems
2. **Safe Data Management** - Handling, processing, and governing data
3. **Safe Access & Identity** - User authentication, authorization, and access control
4. **Safe Outputs & Disclosure Control** - Ensuring non-disclosive research outputs
5. **Safe Projects & Operations** - Project management and operational excellence
6. **Safe Governance & Compliance** - Meeting regulatory and ethical requirements

## Mapping to Five Safes

The framework is designed to align with and support the Five Safes model:

| Competency Framework Domain         | Related Five Safes Principle |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Safe Technology & Engineering       | Safe Settings                |
| Safe Data Management                | Safe Data                    |
| Safe Access & Identity              | Safe People                  |
| Safe Outputs & Disclosure Control   | Safe Outputs                 |
| Safe Projects & Operations          | Safe Projects                |

Governance & Compliance spans across all Five Safes principles.

## Mapping to SATRE

The framework also aligns with the [Standard Architecture for Trusted Research Environments (SATRE)](https://satre-specification.readthedocs.io/) specification, mapping competency domains to key SATRE pillars and capabilities. For example:

| Competency Framework Domain         | Example SATRE Capabilities                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Safe Technology & Engineering       | End user computing, Infrastructure management              |
| Safe Data Management                | Data lifecycle management, Security levels and tiering     |
| Safe Access & Identity              | Identity and access management, Member accreditation       |
| Safe Outputs & Disclosure Control   | Output management                                          |
| Safe Projects & Operations          | Training delivery and management, Business continuity      |
| Safe Governance & Compliance        | Risk management, Study management                          |

While SATRE defines the capabilities of a Trusted Research Environment / Secure Data Environment, our competency framework defines the skills required to develop, deploy and manage those capabilities.

## Framework Applications

This competency framework serves multiple purposes:

1. Supporting career development for RTPs
2. Guiding training and learning pathways
3. Identifying skill gaps in teams and organizations
4. Creating job descriptions and role specifications
5. Supporting recruitment and retention strategies

## Enhanced Competency Areas

The framework has been enhanced to incorporate specialised areas critical to Secure Data Environments:

1. **Healthcare Data Models & Standards** - Working with specialised healthcare data structures like OMOP, FHIR
2. **Enterprise Solution Development** - Building production-ready, scalable solutions
3. **Component-Based Architecture** - Designing modular and reusable system components
4. **Healthcare Regulatory Frameworks** - Implementing NHS-specific standards (DSPT, DTAC)
5. **Code Publication & Reusability** - Sharing code securely while promoting reuse
6. **Resource & Cost Management** - Optimizing cloud resources and managing costs
7. **Community Engagement** - Building networks and sharing knowledge across SDEs

This comprehensive framework represents a complete mapping of competencies from both theoretical frameworks and real-world skills needed by Research Technical Professionals working with Secure Data Environments.
