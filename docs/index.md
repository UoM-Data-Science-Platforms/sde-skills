# Welcome to the SDE Team Development Hub

## Building Capacity and Capability for UK Secure Data Environments

The SDE Team Development Hub is a collaboration between like-minded individuals that aims to find better ways to develop and support Research Technical Professionals (RTPs) that underpin the creation of Secure Data Environments (SDEs).

The project is funded through an EPSRC grant and is led by the University of Manchester in collaboration with Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Liverpool.

## Our Mission

We aim to achieve this through five key initiatives:

### 1. Increasing Capacity

Directly increasing capacity through recruitment of RTPs into existing teams developing SDEs in the Northwest of England.

### 2. Supporting Career Development

Supporting the career development of RTPs through the creation of a competency framework. We are working with the SDE community to define the key competencies that should be attained at different stages of an RTP's career in secure data environments.

### 3. Facilitating Training

Supporting the training of RTPs by developing a curriculum that highlights training and sources of experience that can be used to achieve career progression against the competency framework.

### 4. Certification Support

Facilitating direct training and certification of new and existing RTPs that work on the creation of secure data environments.

### 5. Knowledge Sharing

Developing an online resource to share our outputs and experience with the wider SDE community.
