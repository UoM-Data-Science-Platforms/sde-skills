# Technical Service Delivery for Governance & Compliance in SDEs

This domain covers aspects that underpin activities that enforce governance and compliance in Secure Data Environments (SDEs).


### Information Governance (Technical Platform Support)

Ensures the technical platform supports robust information governance through access controls, data classification, auditability, and policy enforcement.

=== ":material-battery-10: Entry Level"

    - Understands the technical requirements for access control, data classification, and audit logging
    - Can configure and maintain basic access controls and audit logs under supervision (e.g., directory services, identity and access management systems, operating system permissions)
    - Follows established procedures for supporting governance controls in the platform (e.g., IT service management tools, workflow management systems)

=== ":material-battery-50: Mid Level"

    - Implements and automates governance controls (e.g., automated tagging, policy-based access using cloud policy engines or configuration management tools)
    - Integrates governance frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001) into platform operations, leveraging data governance, identity management, or access monitoring platforms
    - Supports compliance teams by providing technical evidence and documentation (e.g., exporting and formatting logs from audit and monitoring platforms)

=== ":material-battery-90: Senior Level"

    - Designs and evolves platform features to meet changing governance requirements (e.g., integrating new modules in workflow or service management systems, extending identity and access management solutions)
    - Leads technical integration of new governance frameworks and standards (e.g., using document management systems for policy and evidence management)
    - Advises on technical strategy for information governance enablement, including platform selection and integration



### Data Protection Compliance (Technical Platform Support)

Delivers technical solutions for data protection, including encryption, pseudonymization, access monitoring, and support for data subject rights.

=== ":material-battery-10: Entry Level"

    - Understands technical controls for data protection (e.g., encryption, pseudonymization)
    - Can implement basic data protection measures under guidance (e.g., disk encryption, key management systems)
    - Follows procedures for supporting data subject rights (e.g., data export, erasure using built-in tools or scripts)

=== ":material-battery-50: Mid Level"

    - Implements and manages encryption at rest and in transit (e.g., network encryption, database encryption)
    - Automates data subject rights processes (e.g., using workflow automation tools, custom scripts, or privacy management platforms)
    - Monitors and reports on access to sensitive data (e.g., using security monitoring and logging platforms)

=== ":material-battery-90: Senior Level"

    - Designs platform capabilities to support evolving data protection requirements (e.g., integrating privacy management or data discovery platforms)
    - Leads technical response to new data protection regulations
    - Advises on technical risk and mitigation strategies for data protection



### Healthcare Standards Compliance (Technical Platform Support)

Ensures the platform meets healthcare-specific regulatory standards and is adaptable to evolving requirements.

=== ":material-battery-10: Entry Level"

    - Understands technical implications of healthcare compliance standards (e.g., DSPT, NHS DTAC)
    - Can assist with configuration and evidence collection for compliance (e.g., using document management systems, collaboration platforms for evidence storage)

=== ":material-battery-50: Mid Level"

    - Implements and maintains technical controls to meet healthcare standards (e.g., using document management, workflow, or compliance dashboard systems)
    - Supports compliance assessments by providing technical documentation and evidence (e.g., exporting reports from document management or collaboration platforms)

=== ":material-battery-90: Senior Level"

    - Designs platform features to meet new or updated healthcare compliance requirements (e.g., integrating document management systems with other compliance tools)
    - Leads technical preparation for external audits and certifications (e.g., using document management systems for audit trails and evidence collation)



### Security Management (Technical Platform Support)

Implements and maintains layered security controls, monitoring, and incident response capabilities.

=== ":material-battery-10: Entry Level"

    - Understands basic security controls (e.g., firewalls, password policies)
    - Can implement and monitor basic security controls under supervision (e.g., network security appliances, endpoint security tools, operating system security policies)
    - Follows incident response procedures and assists with evidence collection (e.g., using security information and event management (SIEM) or log management platforms)

=== ":material-battery-50: Mid Level"

    - Designs and implements comprehensive security controls (e.g., intrusion detection/prevention systems, endpoint protection platforms)
    - Automates security monitoring and alerting (e.g., using SIEM, security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) platforms)
    - Leads technical response to security incidents and supports investigations (e.g., using incident response and threat intelligence platforms)

=== ":material-battery-90: Senior Level"

    - Develops and oversees security architecture for the SDE platform (e.g., zero trust, network segmentation)
    - Leads technical strategy for security management and incident response (e.g., integrating SIEM/SOAR, threat intelligence platforms)
    - Advises on security risk and platform resilience



### Audit & Compliance Monitoring (Technical Platform Support)

Delivers audit trail systems, automated compliance monitoring, and supports certification/accreditation processes.

=== ":material-battery-10: Entry Level"

    - Understands audit logging and compliance monitoring concepts
    - Can implement and maintain basic audit logging under supervision (e.g., operating system logs, cloud audit logs)

=== ":material-battery-50: Mid Level"

    - Implements and manages comprehensive audit trail systems (e.g., log management, monitoring, and reporting platforms)
    - Automates compliance monitoring and reporting (e.g., dashboarding, workflow automation, compliance management tools)
    - Prepares technical evidence for audits and certifications (e.g., exporting logs and reports from document management, SIEM, or compliance platforms)

=== ":material-battery-90: Senior Level"

    - Designs audit and compliance monitoring architecture for the platform (e.g., integrating document management, SIEM, and compliance dashboard systems)
    - Leads technical strategy for certification and accreditation readiness
    - Advises on continuous improvement of audit and compliance capabilities
