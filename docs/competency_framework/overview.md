# Competency Framework Overview

The SDE Skills Competency Framework is designed to map the skills and knowledge needed by Research Technical Professionals (RTPs) working with Secure Data Environments. The framework aligns with established industry models such as the Five Safes and SATRE specifications, while maintaining its unique focus on the technical skills required in secure research environments.

## Framework Structure

The framework is organized as a 3-level hierarchy:

1. **Domains** - Top-level categorization of competencies
2. **Subdomains** - Mid-level grouping of related skills
3. **Items** - Specific competencies with defined skill levels

For each competency item, we define three levels of proficiency:
- **Entry-level** - Basic understanding and application
- **Mid-level** - Independent application and implementation
- **Senior-level** - Strategic oversight and leadership

## Competency Domains

Our competency framework is organized around six core domains that align with both the Five Safes model and SATRE specification:

1. **Safe Technology & Engineering** - Technical implementation of secure systems
2. **Safe Data Management** - Handling, processing, and governing data
3. **Safe Access & Identity** - User authentication, authorization, and access control
4. **Safe Outputs & Disclosure Control** - Ensuring non-disclosive research outputs
5. **Safe Governance & Compliance** - Meeting regulatory and ethical requirements
6. **Safe Projects & Operations** - Project management and operational excellence

## Mapping to Five Safes

The framework is designed to align with and support the Five Safes model:

| Five Safes | Related Framework Domains |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Safe Data | Safe Data Management |
| Safe Projects | Safe Projects & Operations |
| Safe People | Safe Access & Identity |
| Safe Settings | Safe Technology & Engineering |
| Safe Outputs | Safe Outputs & Disclosure Control |

Governance & Compliance spans across all Five Safes principles.

## Mapping to SATRE

The framework also aligns with SATRE (Secure Access to Research Environments) specification components:

- Authentication & Authorization → Safe Access & Identity
- Environment Provisioning → Safe Technology & Engineering
- Data Ingestion & Egress → Safe Data Management
- Resource Management → Safe Projects & Operations
- Audit & Monitoring → Safe Governance & Compliance
- Output Checking → Safe Outputs & Disclosure Control

## Framework Applications

This competency framework serves multiple purposes:

1. Supporting career development for RTPs
2. Guiding training and learning pathways
3. Identifying skill gaps in teams and organizations
4. Creating job descriptions and role specifications
5. Supporting recruitment and retention strategies
