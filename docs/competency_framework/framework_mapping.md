# Competency Framework Mapping

This document provides a detailed mapping of the SDE Skills Competency Framework to established industry frameworks, specifically the Five Safes model and SATRE specification.

## Mapping to Five Safes

The Five Safes framework is a set of principles enabling safe research access to sensitive data. Our competency domains are designed to align with and support these principles:

**Key Competencies:**

- Data classification & sensitivity assessment
- Data lineage & provenance tracking
- De-identification techniques
- Data quality management
- Data storage & database security

### Safe Projects

> *Research projects are approved by data owners for the public good.*

**Primary Domain Mapping:**

- Safe Projects & Operations

**Key Competencies:**

- SDE project planning
- Research project facilitation
- Research ethics compliance
- Service level management
- Researcher training & support

### Safe People

> *Researchers are trained and authorized to use data safely.*

**Primary Domain Mapping:**

- Safe Access & Identity

**Key Competencies:**

- Authentication systems
- User provisioning & lifecycle management
- Role-based access control
